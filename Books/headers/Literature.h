/**
 * 2nd Course K-29
 * Lab 1. Variant 2-10
 * Task: make a class that realise such tasks:
 *      1)gives the information about the book, author, date of wrote etc.
 *      2)gives the information about the main characters of the book, their importance etc.
 *      3)dividing the books on series
 *
 * Purpose:This structure is dedicated to save Books and Characters in comfortable way. It synchronise the
 *         added characters and their mentions in other books. So using this structure You can find the
